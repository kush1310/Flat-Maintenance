<h1>Flat Maintenance System</h1>
A modern, browser-based **maintenance tracking system** designed for residential societies and apartment communities — developed using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`.

---

## Σ Project Overview

The **Flat Maintenance System** is a fully interactive web-based application that enables housing society administrators to:

- Track flat-wise maintenance payments
- Manage flat ownership statuses (Owned, Rented, Empty)
- Generate neat and clean PDF reports
- View payment history year-wise
- Auto-handle multiple months and real-time visual feedback

All without any backend — powered solely by the browser’s frontend stack and local storage.
